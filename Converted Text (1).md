**Supervised Learning: Learning from data to beat cancer.**

**Introduction**

The world is becoming ‘smarter’, from curated and personalized social media feeds, to smartphone lock screen facial recognition to credit card fraud detection, and voice-to-text features like Siri and Google Assistant. All these are done using Machine Learning (ML).

Supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning are subtypes of machine learning. 

Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where algorithms or models learn from or are exposed to labeled datasets (training data) to predict outcomes or classify data. By labeled dataset, means it comes with tags or features that add context or more information about the dataset. An example of a labeled dataset could be a dataset of Magnetic resonance (MR) images, where each data or image comes with a tag that includes the patient's name, ID, biomarkers, malignant, benign, etc

It can also be inferred that these labeled datasets train the algorithms so that they can recognize patterns and predict outcome

Types of supervised learning models range from basic linear regression to decision trees, random forests, neural networks, support vector machines, and polynomial regression.

Unsupervised learning is the opposite, it is an approach where algorithms learn from unlabeled data on their own. This type of learning is unsupervised and human input is minimal.

Semi-supervised learning is an approach that uses both labeled and unlabeled data to train algorithms

The big question is, ‘_How can Supervised learning be used to accurately predict, diagnose, and understand Cancer in Oncology research_?’

**Supervised learning use in improving cancer diagnosis and treatment**

Cancer is a serious public health concern on a global scale. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 1 in every 6 deaths caused by cancer in almost every household. In 2022, 9.7 million people died from cancer, and an estimated new cases of cancer are being diagnosed. The global cancer burden is expected to rise to 77%  by 2050. 

Needless to say, there is a need for early detection, accurate diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer. This is where supervised machine learning comes in. It can identify complex patterns within large labeled datasets such as medical images, and genomics profiles to detect tumors and predict cancer risks.

For example, a research study published on the Science Direct website used supervised learning for the early detection of primary brain tumors in Saudi pediatric patients through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. The model trained on that training data accurately detected the tumors and even matched the radiologists’ report

**Challenges with supervised learning in Cancer diagnosis and treatment**

 

- Poor data quality

- Feature selection

- Scalability 

- Regulatory compliance

**Conclusion** 

Supervised learning is a powerful tool in data science and machine learning that has significant applications in cancer research like early detection of cancer, treatment, and predicting patient outcomes.
